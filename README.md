>*Turning the classic paper and pencil consequences game into musical fun*



# Rules / Template


### The original Consequences game :

The players take turns in contributing sentences to a story. The final story is then read out, usually with hilarious results.

#### Description

Each player starts with a piece of paper. The players each write a phrase as the first step in a story, and then fold the paper to hide the phrase before passing it to the next player.
The steps are as follows, where the things in brackets should be replaced by the chosen words or phrase:

* (boy's name)
* met (girl's name)
* in/at/on (where they met)
* He said (what he said)
* She said (what she said)
* He (what he did)
* She (what she did)
* The consequence was (what happened)

When the players have completed all eight steps, the pieces of paper are unfolded in turn, and the players read out the completed, usually funny, stories.

### Muiscal Consequences :

The major fun part of the original consequences game is that at each turn the player does not know anything about what has com before.
That simply wouldn’t work - we’d just end up with a mangled noise. 
We need to have a template and process that delivers an unexpected or fun/exciting outcome while producing something coherent enough to listen to.

So here is what I think we should do.

1. Like the original game - all players start a version and pass it on.
2. Limit the run time to keep it fresh & fun. Something like a classic punk single of 3m 15s
3. Each turn / track is added to the next available multitrack slot.
    1. The stereo master L+R are reserved for the summed mix which is updated at each turn until the last turn / final mix.
4. The first turn/part should be only the basic drum pattern (ie bd,sd,hh) or other primary element. 
    1. This part should establish and adhere to the tempo & time signature. 
    2. Would we want to include/allow tempo / signature changes here? That might make things less fun / hard work with use of different DAWs
5. Each subsequent turn must only add a single independent element / track (mono or stereo). 
    1. This should be either a single instrument or typical individual part like percussion, break, fill
6. The game should continue until there have been 7 tracks added
7. The 8th turn produces the final mix (consequences) to the master stereo L+R  
    1. Maybe we should also add any FX bus used in final mix as another (mono/stereo) track to the multi-track file for remix-ability
